      <h2>Bowling</h2>
      <p>I have been bowling since 6th grade. It eases my mind, and I enjoy bowling with my family.</p>
      <p>I have 4 main bowling balls that I like to play with and my own bowling bag.</p>
      <p>I would've bowled in high school if it didn't interfere with basketball season.</p>
